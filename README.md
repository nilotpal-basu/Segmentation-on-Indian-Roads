# Semantic Segmentation on Indian Roads (IDD20K-Lite)

This repository contains a project on semantic segmentation of Indian roads using the **IDD20K-Lite dataset**. The project aims to accurately classify and segment various elements in road scenes, such as vehicles, pedestrians, and road signs, leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning techniques.

## Project Overview

The primary objectives of this project are:
- Perform **semantic segmentation** on Indian road scenes to identify and classify objects.
- Utilize the **IDD20K-Lite dataset**, a subset of the IDD dataset tailored for semantic segmentation tasks.
- Build a **lightweight model** suitable for real-world applications with limited computational resources.
- Evaluate model performance using the **Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU)** metric.

## Key Features

1. **Dataset:**
   - The **IDD20K-Lite dataset** contains annotated images of Indian roads, designed for semantic segmentation tasks.
   - Includes challenging real-world conditions such as dense traffic, varying lighting, and diverse objects.

2. **Model Implementation:**
   - Built a deep learning-based **semantic segmentation model**.
   - Preprocessed the dataset with resizing, normalization, and augmentation to improve model generalization.

3. **Evaluation Metrics:**
   - Used **Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU)** as the primary evaluation metric.
   - Achieved competitive performance on segmentation tasks for key classes.
